Simple drag and drop game, User will wait for a Card to reach stage 2


Users Gain points when successfully Dropping right appropriate color on targets when needed.
Users will lose points when they are miss a 'bad seed' Reducing the total amount of points possibe.


As the game goes on, the window for stage 2 will become shorter making it more likely that points will fail.
This will result in either a good plant dying and requireing a user to lose points to bring it back to life, 
or to lose the game if a bad seed survives long enough.
